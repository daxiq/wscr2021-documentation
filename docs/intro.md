# Project Intro

:::tip Before start

This solution is based on Windows OS and some steps could differ between OSs and enviroments

:::

In order to start the project wee need to have installed the following software: 
- XAMPP - for our localhost enviroment and 
- Composer - in order to install Laravel

## Installing XAMPP

Since Laravel is a PHP framework and PHP is a server-side scripting language you will need a server to see your PHP files.
Anyway, you can use programs to emulate a server in your PC.
XAMPP either WampServer: Install Apache, MySql and PHP at Once

**[Get XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html)** and follow the installation steps from their website.

## Installing Composer

Composer is a software known as a dependency management tool in PHP. It installs several PHP packages according to the version or environment of the installed PHP. To install Laravel, Composer must be installed.

Go to [https://getcomposer.org/](https://getcomposer.org/) and install Composer-Setup.exe from the Download link.

:::warning Composer Setup
During installation, you will be asked for the location of the PHP executable.

The default location in XAMPP is `C:\xampp\php\php.exe`

If XAMPP is installed in a different disk, search and select the path where php.exe is located inside your XAMPP.

Now, we are ready to start developing our Laravel project ðŸ˜ƒ.
